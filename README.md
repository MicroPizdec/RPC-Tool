# RPC-Tool (codenamed DimkaCrash)
Just an easy to use app that creates custom Discord rich presence.

💻 This app supports **Windows 10 1809** and above.

🐞 **Bugs?** Please file [an issue](https://github.com/MicroPizdec/RPC-Tool/issues/new), and maybe we'll fix it.

Version: **v1.0.0 Beta** ~~(and because WinUI 3 is raw)~~
